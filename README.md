# Easy Vasp
#### For post-processing vasp and Wannier90 data

This is an easy to use package for plotting band structures generated by 
VASP and Wannier90. Some features can be used automatically, 
for example band structures from Wannier90 and VASP, while other,
for example plotting the band structure with different orbital
projections coloring are wasy to implement as Easy Vasp converts
some VASP and Wannier90 output files to an intuitive format.

Examples will be soon uploaded.
